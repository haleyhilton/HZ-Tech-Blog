# HZ-Tech-Blog

Description
When you visit the site for the first time, you are presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in. When a user clicks on the homepage option they are taken to the homepage but if clocking anything else - they are prompted to sign up or sign in. When they sign up - they are prompted to create a username and password. After signing-up the user can use the sign-in button rather than the sign-up. Then, the user should be presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created. When the user clocks the button to create a new blog post, the title and contents of the post are saved and they are taken back to an updated dashboard with the new blog post.
WHEN I click on an existing blog post.
